Hello and welcome to my Code Review 11.

This Code Review was also pretty challenging and it took many hours to work and achieve the desired results. 

As you will see, there is an extra feature included in my project, which the "Manage Users" panel where we can also edit or delete 
any user, only when logged in as an Admin. There is also an option to "Cancel" an adoption which will take the pet back from the pet_adoption table and put it 
to the animals one again. Furthermore I tried a contact form which I am not sure if it works 100%, but I wanted to try it since we also mentioned it in the prework 
a bit.

When adding a new pet, it works with the URL link. But on register, update profile of the pet or the user, it works with the file_upload.

I tried to incorporate a nice Sidenavbar as well and it works. When in smaller screens you can click on the sandwich bar on the left and it will open and it can close as well with the "x close" button. The site is fully responsive of course and has been tested in different screen sizes. 

I hope that when we learn Symfony it will help us build/create CRUD systems that are not so complicated and with so many files, cause this time, 
the files got a bit more, cause of all the different options that are available like "users, details, senior, contact" etc.. 

This is all for now. Thank you for your time. 

I wish you a great weekend.

Kind regards,
